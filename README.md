# N-Dimensional-Hypercube-Visualization-in-C-

This project in the C programming language focuses on visualizing an n-dimensional hypercube. The hypercube, also known as a tesseract in 4 dimensions, is a geometric shape that extends the concept of a square (2D) or a cube (3D) into higher dimensions. The code will generate and display the hypercube, allowing users to explore and understand its structure in different dimensions.
